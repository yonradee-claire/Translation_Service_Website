# Translation Service Website
Translation Service website: The site is live at https://www.sntranslations.com/

I designed and developed a fully responsive website for a freelance translator offering professional translation services. The site was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

ðŸ’¡ Key Features
- Animated Image Carousel:
A self-rotating carousel displaying the translator's services, highlights and customers' reviews, built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

- Clickable Contact Information:
    - Address Link: Opens Google Maps directly to the translator's location.
    - Phone Number Link: Enables one-tap calling on mobile devices.

- Contact Form with Formspree Integration:
A clean, easy-to-use contact form that sends messages directly to the translatorâ€™s email inbox via Formspree.
The form automatically captures the user's name, email address, and message.

- Responsive Design:
Fully responsive across desktops, tablets, and smartphones for an optimal user experience.
